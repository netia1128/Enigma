# Enigma - Self Evaluation

**Functionality -- 4** 

All functionality outlined in the project spec, including the cracker, has been successfully implemented.

**Object Oriented Programming -- 4**

I implemented a module in this project.  

I also discussed modules vs inheritance models with Megan today and feel like I am finally starting to grasp the concept.  
* Even when you don't need to instantiate something, in OOP you gravitate towards instantiation because it is good for organization.
* Modules are good for housing methods that are/could be used by multiple classes. Modules don't care about state.
* Class methods and superclasses should be used sparingly.

**Ruby Conventions and Mechanics -- 3**   

Generally, I feel like my code is OK. I'm aware that savvier coders would come up with more efficient ways of tackling this project.  
I did try to follow formatting conventions, but I am also sure I made mistakes and did not catch them.

**Test Driven Development -- 2.75**    

For the enigma, encrypt, and decrypt phases, I followed TDD. For the cracker, I found it very difficult to follow TDD (really, the cracker was just difficult all around).  

I did not implement mocks and stubs, but I did ensure that there was robust testing for every method with one exception in my cracker which I need help understanding how to test.  

SimpleCov shows coverage just over 99%.
