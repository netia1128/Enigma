#def encrypt(message, key = need_method_to_generate_random_key, date = )
# The encrypt method takes a message String as an argument. It can optionally take a Key and Date as arguments 
# to use for encryption. If the key is not included, generate a random key. If the date is not included, 
# use today’s date.

# The encrypt method returns a hash with three keys:

# :encryption => the encrypted String
# :key => the key used for encryption as a String
# :date => the date used for encryption as a String in the form DDMMYY
# end

#def decrypt
# Enigma#decrypt(ciphertext, key, date)
# The decrypt method takes a ciphertext String and the Key used 
# for encryption as arguments. The decrypt method can optionally take a date as the third argument. 
#     If no date is given, this method should use today’s date for decryption.

# The decrypt method returns a hash with three keys:

# :decryption => the decrypted String
# # :key => the key used for decryption as a String
# # :date => the date used for decryption as a String in the form DDMMYY
# end
